# Difference-Objects-Classes
I find it very helpful when I am learning new concepts, to relate the information to ideas and concepts that I already understand.  I would like to relate classes and objects to my work at Hobie cat an engineer.  

At Hobie Cat, I work with a variety of products and parts, like kayaks, sails, and accessories, each with its unique set of attributes like material type, size, and model. In OOP, this is similar to how a class works as a general blueprint for a product, and an object is a specific instance of that product.

For example, let’s say I’m working with a kayak.

•	A class defines the structure and behavior of the objects you create.  I would relate this to the design or blueprint for the kayak. It defines common attributes like the material, length, and weight capacity. This is like the engineering spec or design document we use on the production floor, which outlines how each kayak should be produced.

•	An object is created based the blueprint is a specific kayak, like the "Hobie Mirage Outback." This kayak would have its own attributes (material, length, etc.), but it follows the general structure laid out by the class. In manufacturing, and assembly down at our plant in Mexico I deal with specific products (objects), each built according to the shared blueprint (class).
